Marvell USB3 device controller

This controller is integrated in Armada 38x/3700/8K.

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be "marvell,mvebu-u3d"
- reg		: Physical base address and size of the USB3 device registers map.
- interrupts	: Should contain single irq line of USB3 device controller
- clocks	: the clock associated to this controller
- dma-coherent	: if controller is DMA coherent

Optional properties :
- vbus-gpio	: VBUS interrupt GPIO pin
		  set to trigger VBUS event notification to PHY/controller
		  whether VBUS was powered or not
- phys		: the COMPHY associated to this controller
- phy-names:	: the name of COMPHY indicated by above property of phys

Example:
	u3d@520000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-u3d";
		reg = <0x520000 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 60 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&gateclk 24>, <&gateclk 16>;
		dma-coherent;
		vbus-gpio = <&gpio1 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		phys = <&a3700_comphy 1 COMPHY_USB3>;
		phy-names = "usb";
		status = "disabled";
	};
